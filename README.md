# Cipher Project

## Description

This project is a simple cipher program that can encrypt and decrypt text using a simple XOR cipher.
You can also create key with a **non secure** random generator. I hope this can be solve in the future.

## Usage

To use this program, you have to compile it first. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
gcc -o ciph ciph.c
```

Then you can run the program with the following command:

```bash
./ciph <textinputfile> <keyinputfile>
```
